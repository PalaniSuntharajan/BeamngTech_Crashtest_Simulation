The safety of children in vehicles is a critical concern that has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in ASEAN countries where road traffic injuries among young passengers are alarmingly high. This project presents a comprehensive study on the dynamic  odelling and analysis of a trolley used to test child restraint systems (CRS) at the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS) PC3 laboratory. The primary challenge addressed is the inaccurate replication of crash scenarios due to unwanted pitching and yaw motions of the trolley during CRS testing, leading to unreliable evaluation of CRS performance. The objectives of this study are to develop a dynamic model of the trolley using BEAMNG.TECH, analyze its performance to identify and mitigate undesired motions, and validate the model through simulations. The research methodology involves developing a 14-degree-of-freedom (DOF) model of the trolley, simulating its behavior, and using BEAMNG.TECHâ€™s sensors to collect data. Preliminary findings suggest that fine-tuning the trolley parameters significantly reduces undesired dynamic responses, enhancing the accuracy of CRS performance evaluations. These insights are crucial for improving CRS testing methodologies and could inform future regulations and safety standards in the ASEAN region. Further research is recommended to include detailed validation with real-world crash data and exploration of additional factors influencing trolley dynamics.
